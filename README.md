# Monera
**Working in progress** for a Kingdom that contained unicellular organisms.

In short, you should have docker installed.
And then you could do:
```
git clone git@github.com:Ideabile/monera.git --recursive && \
cd monera &&
make
```

After that you should be able to visit your docker-machine address and see the docs.
